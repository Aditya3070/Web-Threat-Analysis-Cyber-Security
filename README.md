# Web-Threat-Analysis-Cyber-Security
🚀 Suspicious Web Threat Interaction Analysis using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 🔍 Overview
-  Cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, making it crucial to detect and mitigate suspicious web interactions that may indicate phishing, malware, or unauthorized access attempts. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning to analyze user behavior, network traffic, and interaction patterns to identify potential threats.
- By implementing a hybrid approach, we ensure both accuracy and efficiency in detecting web-based security risks, providing a robust solution for real-time monitoring and protection.

## 🛠️ Features
- ✔ Comprehensive Data Preprocessing – Cleans, normalizes, and encodes structured and unstructured data.
- ✔ Machine Learning Models – Implements a Random Forest Classifier for efficient threat detection.
- ✔ Deep Learning Approach – Utilizes a neural network (with TensorFlow/Keras) for advanced anomaly detection.
- ✔ Real-Time Analysis & Monitoring – Tracks suspicious activities dynamically.
- ✔ Data Visualization & Reporting – Generates interactive charts to understand threat patterns and model accuracy.
